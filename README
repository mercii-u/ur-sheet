    UrSheet (ursh)

    This idea comes from a project which Tsoding made some time ago, the idea
    is to implement a simple spreadsheet engine which is able to do basic
    arithmetic, it's able to make references to other cells avoiding all
    errors, for sure... Also must be able to clone cells from above...

    There's a file which contains almost all types and errors the program
    can produce, it is located at `sheets/tester`, to execute the program
    go to source and type the following

    $ make
    $ ./UrSh -s <filename> -d <decimal-precision>
